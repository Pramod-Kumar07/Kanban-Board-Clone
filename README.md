Kanban Project
A Kanban board project that helps you manage tasks and workflows effectively.

Project Overview
The Kanban Project is a web-based application that implements the Kanban methodology for managing tasks. It provides a visual representation of workflows using boards, columns, and cards. Each card represents a task that can be moved across columns to indicate its progress.

The main goal of this project is to help individuals or teams organize their work, track progress, and collaborate efficiently.

Features
